#### An old school block breaking game.

### Inspired by [Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/)


### There are only 3 levels in this game as of now. The player has to break the blocks in a level to proceed to the next level. Once the game is over the user has to play from the first level.


### Here are some screenshots of the game.
